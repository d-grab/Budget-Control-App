# Project Description

The application supports users in effectively managing and controlling their expenses. 
Users have the ability to classify their expenditures and view a breakdown of where their money is going based on categories.
The users are able to :
- Add a incomes and spendings

# Project Setup

## First Step 

To run the project, we have to download a zip file from the GitHub repository which contain all of the web application files
![GitHubStep1](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_805/v1683911199/Budget-Control-App/3_sfdym2.png)

After we downloaded the project we need to unpack to any location on our disk drive. We need to install ["NodeJS"](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on our computer
and choose a correct version.

## Second Step

In the Visual Studio Code we need to open the project containing all of the files. After loading successfully to Visual Studio we should install all dependencies that are located in package.json files .

In root of our project we need to run in terminal :
```javascript
npm install
```
![Step2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_298/v1683911373/Budget-Control-App/4_kosnev.png)

## Third Step

### .ENV variables

Next step is to create .env.dev file.
.env.dev file has to be located in the root folder. It's including our firebase configuration variables.


```javascript
REACT_APP_API_KEY=[our details]
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=[our details]
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=[our details]
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=[our details]
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[our details]
REACT_APP_APP_ID=[our details]
```

![.envFile](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_193/v1683911748/Budget-Control-App/5_raex8j.png)

# Firebase Setup

After successfully created account in Firebase platform we need to create [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) project and follow simple
3 steps process.

![New Firebase Project](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_317,q_100/v1683916502/Budget-Control-App/6_ns47ac.png)<br>

- Next step is to register a Web application on Firebase. The Firebase configuration will be used in .env.dev file in our project.

![New Firebase Project](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_345,q_100/v1683921013/Budget-Control-App/13_wshcay.png)

- Secondly We need to create a databse in our web application and enable email/password Authentication to register new users.

![New Database ](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_291,q_100/v1683921230/Budget-Control-App/14_sx5tve.png)<br>

- The project can be create in production mode as everything has been tested. We need to change the rules of our databse that will Allow read/write access on all documents to any user signed in to the application

![New Database ](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,q_100,w_933/v1683921433/Budget-Control-App/15_pqjq4f.png)<br>

- Enabling Email / Password Authentication

![Email/Password Authentication](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_388,q_100/v1684154661/Budget-Control-App/16_xgi1dh.png)

- Changing database rules

```javascript
// Allow read/write access on all documents to any user signed in to the application
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null; }}}
```
![Database Rules](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_322,q_100/v1684161138/Budget-Control-App/20_t7q5gc.png)


# Development mode (Localhost)

The React application is hosted on a development server that is located on the user's local machine. This server offers various functionalities, including hot-reloading, which enables the user to view modifications in real timeÂ without requiring a browser refresh.

After downloading project and installing all dependecies, and creatig .env.dev file with Firebase configuration, the project can be started with build in script 

```javascript
npm run start
```
![Development mode](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_264,q_100/v1684159680/Budget-Control-App/17_mngaja.png)

After creating first account and loggin into the application , the firebase will required to install indexes for collections. In the browser we need to right click and inspect the page in order to access the link and install indexes directly from Cloud Firestore.

![Cloud Indexes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwc3fiaro/image/upload/c_scale,e_sharpen:100,h_385,q_100/v1684163620/Budget-Control-App/18_ssynqc.png)
